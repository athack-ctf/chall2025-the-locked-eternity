# Building Your Challenge

The purpose of this directory is to provide a reproducible way of rebuilding your challenge.

- If your challenge can be programmatically rebuilt, treat this directory as the root of the source code.

- If your process is mainly manual, then it should be documented, along with all necessary files.

- If you have used a special tool (e.g., a file encoding tool) to build the challenge, it should be documented as well.

- For any clarifications, consult us (Anis and Hugo).
