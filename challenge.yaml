    A stolen MacBook. Fragments of a past someone tried to erase. Whatever was left behind is buried deepâ€”hidden, locked, and unyielding.
    One secret note lingers in the void, its meaning just out of reach. The system resists, time works against you.
    Break the silence, or be lost in it forever.
